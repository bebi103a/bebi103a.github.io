For looking up symbols you may need, you can use any of the many [cheat sheets](http://users.dickinson.edu/~richesod/latex/latexcheatsheet.pdf) you can find by asking Google. I have provided a few that will come up often in this course at the [end of this lesson](#Useful-LaTeX-symbols-for-BE/Bi-103).\n",

In general, a backward slash precedes special symbols or commands in LaTeX. If we want another Greek letter, like $\\theta$, we use `\\theta`. Now, also note that I used \"`\\mathrm{e}`\" for the base of the natural logarithm.  I was signaling to LaTeX that I wanted the character written in Roman font, and not italics, so I used `\\mathrm`. Anything in the braces following the function `\\mathrm` is rendered in Roman font. Note the difference.\n",
