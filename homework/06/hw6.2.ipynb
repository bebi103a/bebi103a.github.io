    "In the previous problem we looked at introgressize hybridization from a nonparametric perspective, computing plug-in estimates for the heritability, $h^2$. Now, we will take a parametric approach. We model parental and offspring beak depth as a Bivariate Normal distribution. To be clear, we define $\\mathbf{y} = (b_p, b_o)^\\mathsf{T}$ a 2-vector containing the parental and offspring beak depths. Our model is\n",
