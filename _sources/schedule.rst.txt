Weekly schedule
---------------

The notes for each Monday lesson must be read ahead of time and associated lesson exercises submitted by noon on the Sunday before the lesson. For example, the exercises to be completed after lesson 6 must be submitted by noon on Sunday, October 2.

If one were reading through the lessons, the numbering of the lessons represents the most logical order. However, due to the constrains of class meeting times, some of the lessons are presented out of order. This is not a problem, though, as no lesson that strictly depends on another are presented out of order and the order shown in the schedule below is also a reasonable ordering of the lessons.
