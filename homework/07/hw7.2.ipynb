    "We extend that open-ended problem with another open-ended analysis. Devise a measure for the *shape* of a beak. That is, invent some scalar measure that combines both the length and depth of the beak and justify your choice. Compare this measure between species and through time. (This is very open-ended. It is up to you to define the measure, make relevant plots, compute confidence intervals, and possibly do hypothesis tests to see how shape changes over time and between the two species.)"
