This is accomplished by taking advantage of a unique morphological feature of *Caulobacter*.  The mother cell is adherent to the a surface through its stalk. Upon division, one of the daughter cells does not have a stalk and is mobile. The system is part of a microfluidic device that gives a constant flow. So, every time a mother cell divides, the un-stalked daughter cell gets washed away. In such a way, the dividing cells are never in a crowded environment and the buffer is always fresh. This also allows for easier segmentation.\n", "\n", "We define a growth event as a time period during which a bacterium grows before dividing. After a division, a new growth event begins. Based on image data kindly provided by Charlie Wright and [Sri Iyer-Biswas](https://iyerbiswas.com), I processed the images to get a set of growth events.
