    "# Aliases (PowerShell users, skip this section)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we saw that `rm` is a wrecking ball, we should temper it using the `-i` flag. For safety, we would like `rm` to *always* ask us about deletion. We can instruct `bash` or `zsh` to do this for us by creating an **alias**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    alias rm=\"rm -i\"\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing this, any time we use `rm`, our shell will instead execute `rm -i`, thereby keeping us out of trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful alias, often implemented by default, is to make `ls` list things more prettily.\n",
    "\n",
    "For macOS:\n",
    "\n",
    "    alias ls=\"ls -FG\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "For Linux:\n",
    "\n",
    "    alias ls=\"ls -F --color\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-F` flag makes `ls` put a slash at the end of directories. This helps us tell the difference between files and directories. The `-G` or `--color` flag enables coloring of the output, also useful for differentiating file types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, if you decide to use `rsync`, you may want to alias `rsync -avzP` to `rsync`:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    alias rsync=\"rsync -avzP\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "Aliases will usually be forgotten when you close the current terminal. To make them persistent, add the command to `~/.bashrc` (on most Linux or old macOS) or `~/.zshrc` (on macOS). If these files do not exist, you can create them. "
