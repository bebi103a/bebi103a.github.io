A schematic of the receptor, which is an ion channel, and its five (four unique) subunits, adapted from the book [Physical Biology of the Cell 2](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/pboc2/), is shown below.\n",

We will visit this issue again in the last lecture of the term with another demonstration of how nonidentifiabilities can be problematic.\n",

    "**a)** A common approach to parameter estimation is to find the so-called \"best-fit\" parameters and report them. \"Best fit\" is interpreted in a least squares sense and finding those parameters involves a least squares calculation in which the sum of the squares of the residuals is minimized. This approach is equivalent to performing a maximum likelihood estimate of a model in which the data are Normally distributed about the theoretical curve with a variance $\\sigma^2$ that is the same for all concentrations.

    "**b)** For each \"best fit\" parameter, plot the \"best fit curve\" along with the data. This is the theoretical curve parametrized by the parameters you found in part (a).\n",

    "**c)** In my experience, the vast majority of analyses stop after part (b). **TO GREAT PERIL!** This model/data combination is an example of a case where quantitative interpretation of the estimates you get for the parameters would lead to erroneous conclusions. I will tell you now that this model is not **identifiable** with these measurements. (Remember, when we say a model is not identifiable, it means that we cannot unambiguously determine the parameter values. That is, two or more parameter sets are observationally equivalent.) You job in this part of the problem is to demonstrate that the model is not identifiable. You can use techniques we have learned in class to try to expose the nonidentifiabilities."
