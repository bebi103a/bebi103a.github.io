Methods*, **14**(2), 145-148](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4109)) an improved [Gal4/UAS system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAL4/UAS_system) in *C. elegans*. Briefly, the Gal4-UAS system was hijacked from budding yeast and incorporated into the genomes of other organisms, *Drosophila* being the first. The idea is to insert the Gal4 gene into the genome such that it is under control of a driver that is native to the organism. When Gal4 is expressed, it binds to UAS (upstream activation sequence) and it is activating, leading to expression of the UAS target gene.\n", "\n", "In the paper, Han used the system with UAS activating production of green fluorescent protein (GFP). The Gal4 production is driven by Pmyo-2, which is only expressed in the pharynx of the worm.\n", "\n", "The Gal4/UAS system typically works only at high temperatures. This does not work as well in worms that are stored at lower temperatures. Han therefore engineered a \"cool\" Gal4, which works at lower temperatures. To test how the new system worked, he measured the GFP fluorescence signal in the pharynx of worms.\n", "\n", "He generously donated his data set for us to work with.
