The data set comes from [Nate Goehring](https://goehringlab.crick.ac.uk). The data are taken of a *C. elegans* one-cell embryo expressing a GFP fusion to the PH domain of Protein Lipase C delta 1 (PH-PLCd1). This domain binds PIP2, a lipid enriched in the plasma membrane. By using FRAP, we can investigate the dynamics of diffusion of the PH-PLCd1/PIP2 complex on the cell membrane, as well as the binding/unbinding dynamics of PH-PLCd1. The the FRAP experiment, a square patch of the membrane is exposed to intense light, thereby photobleaching the fluorescent molecules. If we quantify how the fluorescence returns to that region, we can infer the diffusion coefficient of the PH-PLCd1/PIP2 complex as well as the binding rate of the two molecules. These are two important parameters for quantifying this system.\n", "\n", "If $c$ is the concentration of the PH-PLDd1/PIP2 complex on the membrane and $c_\\mathrm{cyto}$ is the concentration of PH-PLCd1 in the cytoplasm (assumed to be spatially uniform since diffusion in the cytoplasm is very fast), the dynamics are described by a reaction-diffusion equation.\n", "\n", "\\begin{align}\n", "\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial y^2}\\right) + k_\\mathrm{on} c_\\mathrm{cyto} - k_\\mathrm{off} c.\n", "\\end{align}\n", "\n", "Here, $k_\\mathrm{on}$ and $k_\\mathrm{off}$ are the phenomenological rate constants for binding and unbinding to PIP2 on the membrane, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient for the PH-PLCd1/PIP2 complex on the membrane.\n", "\n", "In [their paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2010.08.033), the authors discuss techniques for analyzing the data taking into account the fluorescence recovery of the bleached region in time and space.
