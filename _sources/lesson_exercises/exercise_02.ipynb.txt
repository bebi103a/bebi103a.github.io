    "The [Palmer penguins data set](https://towardsdatascience.com/penguins-dataset-overview-iris-alternative-9453bb8c8d95) is a nice data set with which to practice various data science skills. For this exercise, we will use as subset of it, which you can download here: [https://s3.amazonaws.com/bebi103.caltech.edu/data/penguins_subset.csv](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bebi103.caltech.edu/data/penguins_subset.csv). The data set consists of measurements of three different species of penguins acquired at the [Palmer Station in Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Station). The measurements were made between 2007 and 2009 by [Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php).\n",
