Until that time, to get new features or other enhancements into the language, Guido either wrote or (usually) considered a **[Python Enhancement Proposal](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)**, or a **PEP**.  Each PEP is carefully reviewed, and often there are many iterations with the PEP's author(s). Ultimately, Guido decided if the PEP becomes part of the Python language.

    "* Class names are in PascalCase, where every word in the name of the class has the first letter capitalized and there are no spaces between words. (We are not explicitly covering class in thie course.) You will come across PascalCase objects in many packages, which usually means you are instantiating a class.\n",
    "* Module names are short and lower case. Underscores should be avoided unless necessary for readability.\n",
    "* Lines are maximally 79 characters long.\n",
    "* Lines in doc strings are maximally 72 characters long.\n",
    "* Avoid in-line comments; put the comment directly above the code.\n",
    "* Avoid excessive comments that state the obvious.\n",
    "* Generally, put single spaces around binary operators, unless omitting space improves readability.  For example, `x**2 + y**2`. Low precedence operators should have space.\n",
    "* Assignment operators should always have single spaces around them *except* when in keyword arguments. E.g., no space in `f(x, y=4)`.\n",
    "* Put spaces after commas in function definitions and calls. This also applies for lists, tuples, NumPy arrays, etc.\n",
    "* Avoid excessive spaces within parentheses, braces, and brackets.\n",
    "* Use a single blank line to separate logical sections of your code.\n",
    "* Put two blank lines between functions in a `.py` file.\n",
    "* Put all import statements at the top of the file, importing from one module per line.\n",
    "\n",
