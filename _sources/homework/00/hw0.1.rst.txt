Homework 0.1: Configure your team (0 pts)
------------------------------------------

One, and only one, member from your team, please email the course staff the following information.

1. The names of the team members.
2. The GitHub usernames of the team members. (This is not your GitHub account number, but is the usernames. E.g., mine is ``justinbois``.)
3. Which of the Monday sections you are in.
4. A link to the recurring Zoom meeting your team will use for the class. If the meeting has a password, be sure it is embedded in the link. This will hopefully not be used during the term, but if remote learning is necessary, we will put it to use.

The staff email addresses are available from the :ref:`main page of the course<
People>`.
