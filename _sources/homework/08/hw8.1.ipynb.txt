In this problem, we will use results form a similar data set. The data come from [Gandhi, et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.016). Gandhi and coworkers studied the effect of a deletion in the gene coding for arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (aanat), which is a key enzyme in the rhythmic production of melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone responsible for regulation of circadian rhythms. It is often taken as a drug to treat sleep disorders. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of *aanat* deletion on sleep pattern in 5+ day old zebrafish larvae.\n", "\n", "In one of the analyses, the authors compared the average activity of multiple fish over the course of night 6 of their lives. Here, activity is defined as the number of seconds per ten minutes that the fish is moving.

For at least two of these outliers, domain experts have told me that there were developmental problems with the fish. \n", "\n", "**a)** Assuming that the activity of fish for each respective genotype is Normally distributed, obtain MLEs for the mean activity (parameter $\\mu$) for each genotype with confidence intervals.\n", "\n", "**b)** Normal models tend to fail when there are outliers. This is because of their very light tails. If you have an experiment that you suspect may have major deviations, it is often useful to choose a generative model with heavier tails. To that end, model the activity with a Student-t distribution. Obtain MLEs for the parameter $\\mu$ with error bars.
