    "In 1977, John Tukey, one of the great statisticians and mathematicians of all time, published a book entitled *Exploratory Data Analysis*. In it, he laid out general principles on how researchers should handle their first encounters with their data, before formal statistical inference. Most of us spend a lot of time doing exploratory data analysis, or EDA, without really knowing it. Mostly, EDA involves a graphical exploration of a data set.\n",

    "Being able to load in a data set and quickly start exploring it graphically enables you to _think_ about your data set instead being mired in the mechanics of producing a plot. In the notebooks that follow in this lesson, we will learn how to use the Python-based tools for EDA. In particular, we will learn how to use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) to keep the data set organized and accessible and [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/) to make interactive graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we will learn key concepts of data organization and display. Importantly, we will learn about **tidy data**, **split-apply-combine**, and how to **plot all of your data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we march on this trajectory, though, we need to learn a bit about [Numpy](http://numpy.org/) and [Scipy](http://scipy.org/), which form the foundation upon which much of these tools are built."
