    "These methods are useful for wrangling data frames, doing things like unit conversions or computing statistical point estimates. There are plenty of other methods you can find in the [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/), such as `dropna()` and `fillna()`, which are useful for handling missing data, and `duplicated()` and `drop_duplicates()`, which are useful for dealing with repeated data. The Pandas docs, and questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) are among your best references for Pandas usage."

    "The Pandas documentation is a great resource for learning about these methods. In particular, the [section of the user guide on merging, joining, and concatenating](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html) and the section on [reshaping and pivoting](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html) are very useful. They use very small, contrived data frames to demonstrate the concepts. There are benefits to this approach, certainly, but I find it is often easier to grasp the concepts with real examples. In the following sections of this lesson, we will approach these topics with real examples. You can think of the these lessons as valuable introductions and supplements to the official Pandas documentation."
