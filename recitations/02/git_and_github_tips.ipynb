    "Git is extremely useful and powerful, but it can cause serious annoyances if not used carefully. Follow Justin's suggestion from [homework 1](../../homework/01/hw1.4.ipynb): \"it is wise to commit and push often.\" And from [Lesson 2](../../lessons/02/version_control_with_git.ipynb), pull frequently and \"always `git pull` when you start working.\" These practices will go a long way to prevent clashes where two team members have edited the same file at the same time without knowing. **Even if you feel that a particular piece of work is not yet finished, commit and push it any time you step away from it.** It is much better for a teammate to look at work you might feel insecure about due to its incompleteness than to have a horrible merge issue later on."

    "### Use the sandbox exceedingly liberally\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest and easiest way to avoid clashing with group members work is to use the sandbox provided in your GitHub repository extensively. When doing this, each member can work on a differently named file. For example, I might work on `hw3.2_ar.ipynb`, where the `ar` signifies my initials, while my teammate Liana works on `hw3.2_lm.ipynb`. Each team member can have their own version of various pieces of the homework for scratch work. The key reason to do this is that **you might not know when a team member is working on the same file**. If two people are working on the same file at the same time, a **merge conflict** is certain in the near future. One will push to the repository first, leaving changes that the other does not have in the file they are working with. This means that if the second forces a push, their changes will be kept at the expense of the other's. Without additional tools, merging notebooks with disparate changes is very non-trivial. Instead, to avoid all this, both members can work on their own files in the sandbox, discuss various parts, and combine and edit a final submission when the time comes.\n",

    "When you use separate files for each team member in the sandbox, you will often want to look at and build in the work of your teammates. This means that you will often pull material from the repo and open the notebooks of others. If you run this notebook and poke around in it, you may make a \"change\" in the document that you do not intend to. If you commit and push this change, you might cause a merge conflict with changes the owner of this file has made since you last pulled. If you insist on pushing, you might destroy another's work. If you check `git status` and see a change in such a file that you don't want to push, use `git checkout FILE_NAME_HERE` to discard your non-change-changes and prevent later merge conflicts.
