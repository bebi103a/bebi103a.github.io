If you know how many times you have to do something (or if your program knows), use a `for` loop. If you don't know how many times the loop needs to run until you run it, use a `while` loop. For example, when we want to do something with each character in a string or each entry in a list, the program knows how long the sequence is and a `for` loop is more appropriate. In the previous examples, we don't know how long it will be before we hit the start codon; it depends on the sequence you put into the program. That makes it more suited to a `while` loop."
