In this [data set](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bebi103.caltech.edu/data/finch_beaks.csv), you will find measurements of the beak length (tip to base) and beak depth (top to bottom) of these finches in the years 1973, 1975, 1987, 1991, and 2012. Also included in that data set is the band number for the bird, which gives a unique identifier.

That is, invent some scalar measure that combines both the length and depth of the beak and justify your choice. Compare this measure between species and through time. (This is very open-ended. It is up to you to define the measure, make relevant plots, compute confidence intervals, and possibly do hypothesis tests to see how shape changes over time and between the two species.
