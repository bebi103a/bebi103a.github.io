22. Reproducible workflows
==========================

`Griffin Chure <https://gchure.github.io>`_ will give a guest lecture on reproducible workflows and using version control software to facilitate them. He inspired us to do this because "Everything you do as a scientist is for other people to use."

You can read his recent writing on this `here <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2210.02593>`_.


Guidelines for reproducible research
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

He gave five guidelines to keep in mind when conducting research.

1. Reproducibility starts from project *inception*, not completion.
2. Draft the layout of your analysis, even if you don't know how it will change.
3. Document as you go along, not when your colleague wants to use your code.
4. Separate your code by what it does, not when you'd use it.
5. Sunlight (UV) is the best disinfectant. Work in the open unless legally forbidden.

- He encourages you to read about how to choose a license for your work from `Creative Commons <https://creativecommons.org/choose/>`_.
- He presented an example of how version control and careful organization of his code and protocols was used to do reproducible research to study the energetics of molecular adaptation in transcriptional regulation.

- He also provided a template repository for how he structures his research that you can clone and use for your own work. You can access it `here <https://github.com/gchure/reproducible_research>`_.
