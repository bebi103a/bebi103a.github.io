There are plenty of other methods you can find in the [Polars documentation](https://docs.pola.rs).

    "The Pandas documentation is a great resource for learning about these methods. In particular, the [section of the user guide on joining concatenating, unpivoting, and pivoting](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/transformations/) is very useful. They use very small, contrived data frames to demonstrate the concepts. There are benefits to this approach, certainly, but I find it is often easier to grasp the concepts with real examples. In the following sections of this lesson, we will approach these topics with real examples. You can think of the these lessons as valuable introductions and supplements to the official Polars documentation."
