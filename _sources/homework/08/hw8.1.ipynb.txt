This brings traits from *G. fortis* into the *G. scandens* genome. As this may be a mode by which beak geometries of *G. scandens* change over time, it is useful to know how **heritable** a trait is. Heritability is defined as the ratio of the covariance between parents and offsprings to the variance of the parents alone. To be clear, the heritability is defined as follows.\n", "\n", "1.
